4. Features and Highlights
   Business Problem : With the rapid growth of electric vehicles, analyzing adoption patterns across regions, manufacturers, and vehicle types becomes complex. Raw datasets do not easily reveal trends, market leaders, or eligibility insights required by policymakers, analysts, and business stakeholders.

  Goal of the Dashboard
  •	Provide a centralized, interactive view of EV adoption
  •	Track growth trends by model year
  •	Compare BEV vs PHEV penetration
  •	Identify top manufacturers and models
  •	Analyze CAFV eligibility distribution
  •	Enable filtering by city, electric utility, and vehicle type

  Walkthrough of Key Visuals
  📌 KPI Cards
  •	Total Vehicles – Overall EV count
  •	Average Electric Range – Mean electric range across vehicles
  •	BEV Vehicles (%) – Share of Battery Electric Vehicles
  •	PHEV Vehicles (%) – Share of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles

📈 Total Vehicles by Model Year (Line Chart)
    Shows year-over-year growth in EV registrations, highlighting adoption trends and peak growth periods.
